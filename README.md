JavaExercise35.01InsertRecordsApp

You must have Intellij or some IDE that is configured to run both mySQL, and javaFX; If you don't the program will fail to work properly.

This program uses both javaFX and mySQL to make a program that connects this GUI to a SQL database by using a class called DBConnectionDialog.java. In the DBConnectionDialog class, you will be able to input all your necessary data for your database,
and try to connect to said database, if you fail to connect you probably inputted something incorrectly, make sure when you connect, you have your host name(usually localhost) your database name(it is your schema name, for me it was exercise35_01random).
then your username(usually is root) and password. Then click connect and if everything is setup properly it will connect and insert a bunch of random data using batch or no batch updates.

The location of the source code is Exercise35_01 folder -> src/main -> java/com/example/exercise35_01 -> InsertRecordsApp.java & DBConnectionDialog.java
